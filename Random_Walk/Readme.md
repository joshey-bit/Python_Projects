# Random_Walk

Generate data for a random walk, matplotlib


#### Intro:
A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, each of which is left entirely to chance.
Application of random walks in nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and economics. 
For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop of water moves across the surface of the water 
because it is constantly being pushed around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a
water drop is random, so the path a pollen grain traces out on the surface is a random
walk.
